    # These are group-level variables associated with the "all"
    # group. Ansible gives many options with respect to variable
    # playment, but for a simple example playbook, embedding them in
    # the inventory file is acceptable. The "ansible_*" variables
    # serve as input for the "network_cli" transport method
    # which allow Ansible to connect to our routers. The "ntp_*"
    # variables are user-defined and represent that NTP servers we
    # are configuring in our main playbook.
